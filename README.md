#Analyzing stock data to provide best stock for green energy
---
Generate a code to analize the stocks to provide the best options. We are computing the total volume and return (taking the price of closing at the beggining and the end of the year) of each stock in a year.  Return will be the starting price divided by the ending price minus 1.

To make this analysis we are using a nested loop.  The first for loop will be used to loop the tickers, then the second for loop will be used to loop all rows from 2nd row to last row.
